-------------------------------------------

This app needs an API Key from The Movie Database in order to work.
You must apply to TMDb for your own Key. 
To apply, create your own account here(https://www.themoviedb.org/?_dc=1521124001)
Once you have received an API key, you can insert it in the BuildConfig.java file.
I have marked the line with a TODO. 
Please be aware that it is illegal to upload your API key to GitHub, so please remember
to take the key out of your code before uploading to GitHub or any other public forum.
